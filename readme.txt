This is a group project completed at the SIT Acedemy Data Scince Boot Camp.

The prpose of the project is to learn to use the twitter API to build a database, then use the database to reveal the information included within. 
We will focus on the hashtags #iPhone14 and #iPhone14Pro. We will scrap a much informaiton as possible linked to these hashtags and analyize it. 
Out hope is the get a general evaluatory response from the public regarding these new products, and potentially understand what important people are 
saying about them.
